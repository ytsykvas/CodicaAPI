### Prerequisites
Ruby 3.2.2,  Rails 7.1.3, PostgreSQL, Puma 5.0, Devise, Simple Token Authentication, Postman app for manual testing of requests.
### Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:ytsykvas/CodicaAPI.git
```
Install dependencies:

bundle install
```
Set up the database:
```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```
Start the server:
```
rails server
```
Your app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Postman
When you will test it with Postman remember that header should include ``X-User-Token`` that is autogenerated for each user when user is creating.
And second header is ``X-User-Email``.  You can get both from response body after creating user.

This can make your testing in Postman faster: [my request collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t0vAvy2Dy-KWx_k7krrg9lx-5fX3GHwc?usp=drive_link).
You can import it to your Postman.
